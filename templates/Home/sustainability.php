                <p class="pera">With 15.47 metric tonnes, Australia has the 12th largest carbon emissions per capita in
                    the world (World Bank, CO2 Emissions (Metric Tons per Capita) - Australia | Data,2022). The
                    construction sector contributes 18.1 percent of Australia's carbon footprint, making it one of the
                    worst polluting sectors in the economy (Yu, Man, et al., 2017) and this is without considering the
                    lifetime energy consumption of commercial and residential buildings that accounts for 33.3% of the
                    total carbon emission in Australia (What Are the Sources of Australia’s Greenhouse Gases? -
                    CSIRO,2022).</p>

                <h2 class="text-center text-secondary" >Impact</h2>
                <p class="pera">In order to cut carbon emissions and keep the global temperature rise below 2˚C,
                    Australia and the Australian construction sector must consider the cultivation of industrial hemp.
                    As previously mentioned, Hemp carries incredible properties. The plant regenerates the soil, doesn’t
                    require agro-chemicals, doesn’t require much water to grow, and the growing process is carbon
                    negative. The positive impact of hemp for the environment is not only associated to the crop, but
                    also to the products that can be derived from processing the stalk, leaves and seeds. The
                    introduction of hempcrete as a building material not only lowers the CO2 emissions produced by the
                    construction industry (particularly by diminishing the reliance on concrete) but it also captures
                    CO2 locking it into the building walls. In addition to carbon savings, thanks to its high insulation
                    values and high thermal performance, hempcrete allows the construction of buildings that are up to
                    83% more energy efficient, further lowering CO2 emissions from energy consumption and transforming
                    carbon savings into cash for the end consumer. In fact, contractors, businesses, builders and
                    homeowners have the potential to save money and/or to sell carbon credits on the open market.
                    Although, economically our solution provides direct benefits to farmers and to the Australian
                    construction sector in the form of saving and carbon credits, the positive environmental impact
                    affects all citizens.</p>
